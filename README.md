# Bash Helper Functions

## Installation & Usage

* Clone the repository and source the utility files or download the files individually.
* `source` the utility files you want to use.
* Start calling the utility functions and using the constants.

## What is this?
These are a collection of bash utilities that I use every day in my line of
work as a Software Engineer.

Pull Requests are welcomed if they add more utility functions or make the
current ones less bug-prone and portable to other environments.
